# Colorway Poker 🎨🃏

A strategic, turn-based card game designed to master advanced color theory. Identify color harmonies, manage your bankroll, and race against the clock in this high-stakes chromatic challenge.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1.  **Select Difficulty**: Choose between *Easy Deal*, *Real Deal*, or *Color Pro*. Difficulty affects your time limit and payout multiplier.
2.  **Analyze the Objective**: Each round presents a color theory goal (e.g., "Complementary Pair" or "Analogous Trio").
3.  **Pick Your Cards**: Click on the cards in your hand that fulfill the objective. Selected cards are visually elevated with a star seal.
4.  **Play Your Hand**: Hit the "Play Hand" button to submit.
5.  **Win Big**: Correct selections reward you with a "Jackpot" based on the goal's difficulty and your remaining time. 
6.  **Avoid the Bust**: Incorrect selections or running out of time results in a penalty to your bankroll.
